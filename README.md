- 👋 Hi, I’m Jordan (@imjorman)
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and learning about making future predictions based on previous events.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything where people need help.  I'm mostly interested in data science, and really interested in its application in sport, but I'm excited to help wherever there is a need so I can develop new skills. 
- 📫 The best way to get a hold of me is via Twitter @imjorman.
